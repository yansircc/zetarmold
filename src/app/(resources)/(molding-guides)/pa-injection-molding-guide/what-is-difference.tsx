            question: '1. PA 6 (Nylon 6):',
            answer:
              'PA 6 (Nylon 6) is produced by the ring-opening polymerization of caprolactam. It offers excellent toughness, flexibility, and high tensile strength. With superior abrasion resistance, PA 6 is ideal for applications involving wear, such as gears and bearings. It also has good chemical resistance to oils and solvents, though it is susceptible to strong acids and bases. PA 6 is commonly used in textiles (e.g., nylon stockings), automotive components (e.g., air intake manifolds, fuel lines), and electrical equipment (e.g., cable ties, connectors).',
